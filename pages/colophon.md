## Tech

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
Jekyll has been my favorite static site generator due to it's straightforward templating and lack of javascript stuff that I don't fully grasp. 

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
I'm amazed at how great Netlify is for hosting and deploying Jekyll sites&mdash;or any JAMstack site, really.

### [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
Having some kind of CMS for this project was crucial because I wanted to be able to add hikes during the drive back home&mdash;before I started to forget details about the outing. This open-source tool was fairly easy to configure and even easier to use when setup is complete.

### [Jekyll + Netlify CMS Boilerplate](https://templates.netlify.com/template/jekyll-with-netlify-cms-boilerplate/)
I used this boilerplate to get the project off the ground as fast as possible instead of noodling with the tech. I got up to speed on how Netlify CMS works with Jekyll way faster than if I had tried staring from scratch.

## Fonts

### [Granville](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/granville)
Created by Jean-Baptiste Lev√©e at [Production Type](https://www.productiontype.com/).

### [National Park Typeface](https://nationalparktypeface.com/)
A collaborative project by [Design Outside Studio](https://jeremyshellhorn.com/Design-Outside-Studio) designed to mimic the type carved into wooden National Park Service signs.
